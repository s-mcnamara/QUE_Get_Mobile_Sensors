# QUE_Get_Mobile_Sensors
Source code used to complete challenge III on the John Jay D4CS Qualifying exam Jan. 2014:

A major advantage of smart devices is that they have a variety of sensors, which desktop or laptop computers do
not contain. For example, the oscillometer sensor embedded in many popular handheld devices, such Android
phones and iOS enabled devices, can measure and record the movement of a device while it is traveling
horizontally or vertically. Such information is useful to estimate the number of steps that the user of a device has
taken or even how many flights of stairs the device holder has climbed. Another example is the location sensor
that records the latitude and longitude information of a device, which obviously helps greatly in identifying
where the device is.
In this challenge, your task is to research different types of embedded sensors of mobile devices. You may pick
any smart device, such as an Android phone , iPhone, Android system based tablet or iPad, and do the following:
1. For the device that you picked, do a through investigation on ALL kinds of sensors embedded in the
device. Write a short survey on the sensor types, what they can do, and usually what kinds of
applications use them. Here, please note that camera and audio recorder can also also be sensors.
2. Maintain a real-time PLog as you work in which you record your thinking and steps in your
investigation and tool development. You are not penalized for recording false starts or dead ends.
3. Write a simple piece of program that can call corresponding system interfaces and record the sensor
readings of two types of sensors in real time. For example, you may write a piece of code that records
the location information and the oscillometer reading of a device every 30 seconds, and put the logs of
such information in a separate file. You are free to use a programming platform of your choice and are
free to may choose any two sensor types as you wish.
4. Run your program while you generate reasonable activities for three hours. For example, you may walk,
then run, then stay seated, then walk again for 30 minutes while your application is running and
capturing the readings of the corresponding sensors that you chose. If you conduct such experiments for
30 minutes each time, you will need to do it six times to make the total length of the measurement study
three hours long.
5. Prepare a well-written and detailed report that contains the survey from Step 1, the explanation of
experiment setup, the format of your data record, and a simple data analysis of the logs that you
gathered. For the data analysis part, please generate reasonable figures and/or tables to help in
visualizing the data. For example, you may tie the location sensor readings with Google map to show the
route that you traveled during the experiments.
6. Consider the forensic potential of the tool you developed for various types of investigative purposes.
7. Attach the source code of your program as an appendix.
